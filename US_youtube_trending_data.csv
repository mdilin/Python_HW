It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

And thanks to his expected brilliance, Messi's side advanced to the quarterfinals. A trio of first-half goals gave the La Liga side a 3-1 win over their opponent, providing a 4-2 aggregate win that saw Barcelona through to the final eight.Lionel Messi, who had a lot on the line entering, scored a fantastic goal in the first half to help build an early 3-1 halftime advantage against their Serie A opposition. Luis Suarez and Clement Lenglet also contributed to the lead with goals of their own, while all Napoli was able to respond with was a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne. The halftime score held for the final 45, ensuring Barcelona's date with Bayern Munich on Friday.Stream every UEFA Champions League match live on CBS All Access: https://www.cbs.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/Subscribe to UCL on CBS Sports: https://www.youtube.com/UCLonCBSSports#UCL #Barcelona #Napoli #ChampionsLeague #Messi #LionelMessi #Soccer #EuropeanSoccer"

By popular request, I am back with another video, fixing different art projects that I've done in past videos. I love re-painting and giving a makeover to different things that need some help, including stuff that I've ruined myself 😂 These videos are also really fun because it's basically just a collection of different art activities that I like to do like squishy makeovers, painting on paint palettes and customizing things.If you want to see the original creation of these items, here is where to find the videos:Face of Failure Squishy Girl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PTOoZAgr6Y&t=869s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabethHydro Dipped Palette and Container: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLrWkWuDjw&t=352s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabethSign up for the mailing list on my new online store to get early access to new products:https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

But that didn't stop them from putting on a show.Bayern Munich are through to the Champions League quarterfinals after thumping Chelsea on Saturday. Bayern Munich won the second leg, 4-1, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice. The Bundesliga winners came into the second leg with a 3-0 advantage, so they ended up with a 7-1 aggregate edge over their Premier League opponent.The German side was able to capitalize on their first leg momentum early as Lewandowski, the competition's leading score, earned a penalty kick in the 10th minute and converted the attempt. Bayern added goals throughout with Ivan Perisic scoring in the 24th minute, and Corentin Tolisso adding to the scoreline fresh off the bench during the 76th minute. Lewandowski headed home the 13th goal of his Champions League campaign in the 84th minute.

Starring Daniel Kaluuya and LaKeith Stanfield.  Only in theaters 2021.  “You can murder a revolutionary, but you can’t murder a revolution.https://twitter.com/wbpictureshttps://www.instagram.com/wbpictures https://www.facebook.com/WarnerBrosPictures/Chairman Fred Hampton was 21 years old when he was assassinated by the FBI, who coerced a petty criminal named William O’Neal to help them silence him and the Black Panther Party.  But they could not kill Fred Hampton’s legacy and, 50 years later, his words still echo…louder than ever. I am a revolutionary!         In 1968, a young, charismatic activist named Fred Hampton became Chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, who were fighting for freedom, the power to determine the destiny of the Black community, and an end to police brutality and the slaughter of Black people.Chairman Fred was inspiring a generation to rise up and not back down to oppression, which put him directly in the line of fire of the government, the FBI and the Chicago Police.  But to destroy the revolution, they had to do it from both the outside…and the inside.  Facing prison, William O’Neal is offered a deal by the FBI: if he will infiltrate the Black Panthers and provide intel on Hampton, he will walk free.  O’Neal takes the deal.         Now a comrade in arms in the Black Panther Party, O’Neal lives in fear that his treachery will be discovered even as he rises in the ranks.  But as Hampton’s fiery message draws him in, O’Neal cannot escape the deadly trajectory of his ultimate betrayal.         Though his life was cut short, Fred Hampton’s impact has continued to reverberate.  The government saw the Black Panthers as a militant threat to the status quo and sold that lie to a frightened public in a time of growing civil unrest.  But the perception of the Panthers was not reality.  In inner cities across America, they were providing free breakfasts for children, legal services, medical clinics and research into sickle cell anemia, and political education.  And it was Chairman Fred in Chicago, who, recognizing the power of multicultural unity for a common cause, created the Rainbow Coalition—joining forces with other oppressed peoples in the city to fight for equality and political empowerment.“Judas and the Black Messiah” stars Oscar nominee Daniel Kaluuya (“Get Out,” “Widows,” “Black Panther”) as Fred Hampton and LaKeith Stanfield (“Atlanta,” “The Girl in the Spider’s Web”) as William O’Neal.  The film also stars Jesse Plemons (“Vice,” “Game Night,” “The Post”), Dominique Fishback (“The Hate U Give,” “The Deuce”), Ashton Sanders (“The Equalizer 2,” “Moonlight”) and Martin Sheen (“The Departed,” TV’s “The West Wing,” TV’s “Grace & Frankie”).“Judas and the Black Messiah” is directed by Shaka King, marking his studio feature film directorial debut.  The project originated with King and his writing partner, Will Berson, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Kenny Lucas & Keith Lucas, who co-wrote the story with Berson & King.  King, who has a long relationship with filmmaker Ryan Coogler (“Black Panther,” “Creed,” “Fruitvale Station”), pitched the film to Coogler and Charles D. King (“Just Mercy,” “Fences”), who are producing the film.  The executive producers are Sev Ohanian, Zinzi Coogler, Kim Roth, Poppy Hanks, Ravi Mehta, Jeff Skoll, Anikah McLaren, Aaron L. Gilbert, Jason Cloth, Ted Gidlow, and Niija Kuykendall.The ensemble cast also includes Algee Smith (“The Hate U Give,” “Detroit”), Darrell Britt-Gibson (“Just Mercy,” “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”), Dominique Thorne (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Amari Cheatom (“Roman J. Israel, Esq.,” “Django Unchained”), Caleb Eberhardt (“The Post”), and Lil Rel Howery (“Get Out”).The behind-the-scenes creative team includes director of photography Sean Bobbitt (“12 Years a Slave,” “Widows”), production designer Sam Lisenco (“Shades of Blue”), editor Kristan Sprague (“Random Acts of Flyness”) and costume designer Charlese Antoinette Jones (“Raising Dion”).The film is a Warner Bros. Pictures presentation, in association with MACRO Films, Participant and BRON Creative, and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures."

Thanks for watching during all of this, it means a lot to all of us. That said, we need to make a few changes with everything going on in the world. James and Mike Monday is on hiatus until February. Rental Reviews is cancelled, but the RR guys (Justin, Kieran, Tony) will be working behind the scenes and will guest-host some upcoming videos. There will be more random videos (like music videos and scripted reviews), plus monthly AVGN and YKWBS. The new release schedule is every Tuesday and Friday at Noon EST. Conventions and any films we were planning are getting pushed back, but my book should make a lot of headway this year. The new AVGN video game will come out this fall sometime on all systems. 🎮 Add AVGN 1+2 Deluxe to your Steam Wishlist: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162960/Angry_Video_Game_Nerd_I__II_Deluxe/Follow us on Twitter:James - https://twitter.com/cinemassacreMike Matei - https://twitter.com/Mike_MateiRyan - https://twitter.com/schottrJusty - https://twitter.com/JustySilvermanKieran - https://twitter.com/KieeeeernTony - https://twitter.com/HacktheMoviesCinemassacre Shirts, DVDs, and Blu-rays: https://store.screenwavemedia.com/collections/cinemassacreMerch on Amazon.com: https://amzn.to/2ORk1s8Teespring exclusive shirts: https://teespring.com/stores/cinemassacreClick to Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=JamesNintendoNerdFollow#Cinemassacre #JamesRolfe #Update"

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

"MKHriv5r8pk","Meet Kohl (Date #3) | Brooklyn's 10 DATES in 10 DAYS","2020-08-10T21:04:32Z","UC6QWhGQqf0YDYdRb0n6ojWw","Brooklyn and Bailey","24","2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","[None]","696455","31155","344","5260","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKHriv5r8pk/default.jpg","False","False","Brooklyn is going on TEN DATES in TEN DAYS! (This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos. You can check those out here!💥 Identical Twins Switch Places | Will Bailey’s Boyfriend Notice?

And thanks to his expected brilliance, Messi's side advanced to the quarterfinals. A trio of first-half goals gave the La Liga side a 3-1 win over their opponent, providing a 4-2 aggregate win that saw Barcelona through to the final eight.Lionel Messi, who had a lot on the line entering, scored a fantastic goal in the first half to help build an early 3-1 halftime advantage against their Serie A opposition. Luis Suarez and Clement Lenglet also contributed to the lead with goals of their own, while all Napoli was able to respond with was a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne.

Bayern Munich won the second leg, 4-1, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice. The Bundesliga winners came into the second leg with a 3-0 advantage, so they ended up with a 7-1 aggregate edge over their Premier League opponent.The German side was able to capitalize on their first leg momentum early as Lewandowski, the competition's leading score, earned a penalty kick in the 10th minute and converted the attempt. Bayern added goals throughout with Ivan Perisic scoring in the 24th minute, and Corentin Tolisso adding to the scoreline fresh off the bench during the 76th minute. Lewandowski headed home the 13th goal of his Champions League campaign in the 84th minute.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Matt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

last to change 'emBut even if I do it my past can't erase itThey recognize me 'cause they see me on the internetThey think I owe 'em somethin' I can't deal with all the disrespectSick to my stomach, when I feel it I just disconnectMy demons tend get the best of me when I get depressedI've been stabbed in the back with a chainsawBut who am I to blame y'all, I'm smokin 'til the pain's goneYou see me smilin on the surface tryna stay strongActin' like I'm happy starts to feel like it's my day jobBut just as long as there's a purpose to it allI'll keep tourin workin' hard, writin verses to these songsFar from perfect, every person has their flawsAnd mine is I'm an addict still searchin for a causeI know they judge me for mistakes that I've madeSince I've gained all this fame shit just ain't been the sameI came in the game to pave a lane for my nameAnd it's painful to say it put's restraints on my brain butI know it's worth it cause I get to tell my storyI'm at a point where the industry can't ignore meI never had the main stream media to endorse meI did this all by me and myself and y'all are cornyTo every kid that's listenin to this songI hope you've found the message I've written within it allIf no one's ever there to pick you up when you fallI promise you're not alone, play this shit and just hit the wall 'causeI've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin

breakthroughYou thought it was a phase so you pretend you're in a great moodI know it hurts to see reflections of yourself'Cause the person that you see is not like everybody elseSo you try and you try but it never seems to helpSo you're questionin' your words 'cause you're so fed up with the guiltBut...You're not the only one that's goin' through regretYou're not the only one that no one seems to getYou're not the only one that's so close to the edgeAnd if you slip it's over for you so you cope with it insteadI can promise you that nobody is perfect and you overthink the little shit you're always so concerned withSo you lock yourself inside everynight and close the curtainsAnd you're screamin' out loud but it's like no one even heard itI know problems keep pilin' up right in front of youSo much anxiety inside you don't know what to doBeen lied to so much you that you don't think you even want the truthFuck it, aww you grew to be used it, it ain't nothin' newI been there too, just hold tightA lot of substance abuse and long nightsBut next time I see all my demons it's on sightNext time I see all my demons it's on sight yeah....I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Discretion advised. The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

And thanks to his expected brilliance, Messi's side advanced to the quarterfinals. A trio of first-half goals gave the La Liga side a 3-1 win over their opponent, providing a 4-2 aggregate win that saw Barcelona through to the final eight.Lionel Messi, who had a lot on the line entering, scored a fantastic goal in the first half to help build an early 3-1 halftime advantage against their Serie A opposition. Luis Suarez and Clement Lenglet also contributed to the lead with goals of their own, while all Napoli was able to respond with was a penalty from Lorenzo Insigne. The halftime score held for the final 45, ensuring Barcelona's date with Bayern Munich on Friday.Stream every UEFA Champions League match live on CBS All Access: https://www.cbs.com/shows/uefa-champions-league/Subscribe to UCL on CBS Sports: https://www.youtube.com/UCLonCBSSports#UCL #Barcelona #Napoli #ChampionsLeague #Messi #LionelMessi #Soccer #EuropeanSoccer"

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.)

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Discretion advised. The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos. You can check those out here!💥 Identical Twins Switch Places | Will Bailey’s Boyfriend Notice?

In the case of UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic's rubber match with Daniel Cormier at UFC 252, however, the third meeting surpassed anything that happened in the first two bouts as Miocic managed to outwork Cormier over five rounds for a unanimous decision victory in a thrilling battle.The hype train of rising bantamweight Sugar Sean O'Malley took a detour on its trip toward crossover stardom after an apparent leg injury led to an opportunistic finish from Marlon Chito Vera on Saturday.The first round and a half of the UFC 252 heavyweight clash between Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Junior dos Santos belonged to dos Santos, but Rozenstruik proved once again that it only takes one of his shots to turn a fight, scoring a TKO in the second round to rebound from a devastating loss in his last outing.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC252 #Miocic #Cormier #UFC #MMA #SugarSeanOMalley #ChitoVera #Rozenstruik #JuniorDosSantos"

A character based on the doll is a reoccurring antagonist in the Conjuring Universe.BackgroundAccording to the Warrens, a student nurse was given the doll in 1970. They say the doll behaved strangely, and that a psychic medium told the student that the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named Annabelle. The student and her roommate tried to accept and nurture the spirit-possessed doll, but the doll reportedly exhibited malicious and frightening behavior. It was at this point that the Warrens say they were first contacted, moving the doll to their museum after pronouncing it demonically possessed.  The doll remains in a glass box at The Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. Texas State University assistant professor of religious studies Joseph Laycock says most skeptics have dismissed the Warren's museum as full of off-the-shelf Halloween junk, dolls and toys, books you could buy at any bookstore. Laycock calls the Annabelle legend an interesting case study in the relationship between pop culture and paranormal folklore and speculates that the demonic doll trope popularized by films such as Child's Play, Dolly Dearest, and The Conjuring likely emerged from early legends surrounding Robert the Doll as well as a Twilight Zone season 5 episode 6 titled Living Doll (in which the character of the mother is coincidentally named Annabelle), released 5 years prior to the Warren's story. Laycock suggests that the idea of demonically-possessed dolls allows modern demonologists to find supernatural evil in the most banal and domestic of places."

So today’s video is….a little different. I was feeling a little overwhelmed with ideas (aka super spazzy, sorry about the intro lol) and so I decided to just kind of have a free for all today and not plan anything in advance….in order to avoid commitment hhaa. I gave myself a bunch of options for different art activities to do including painting squishies, making custom pencil pouches, painting on tote bags, decorating seashells, rock painting, custom painting vans, my sketchbook, decorating outlet covers etc. All of these I’ve done at some point on my channel. Some of them have become my kinda go-to, and some of them I hadn’t done in quite a while.This is kinda like a spazzy paint with me video 🤣 But, hopefully it can give you some fun ideas for things to customize.

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

And it looks pretty darn good, as long as you stay more than six feet away.✰ SEWING SUPPLIES ✰my fabric scissors (i swear by these: https://amzn.to/3aroV9t)sewing machine (https://amzn.to/2SNSub2)fabric i used (https://bit.ly/2CoUAvI)vintage patterns (https://bit.ly/3aoS1q6, https://bit.ly/2POKKpU)✰ OUTFITS ✰INTRO + SHOPPING OUTFITt-shirt: vintage from @shop_suki on instagram (similar: https://bit.ly/3kGzDh6)pants: other stories (https://bit.ly/3cetfZn, similar: https://bit.ly/33QzjGr)gold hoops + necklace: mejuri (http://youtube.mejuri.com/bestdressed)mask: oh seven days (https://bit.ly/3auvvfC)SEWING OUTFITpink cardigan: aritzia (sold out, similar: https://bit.ly/31PHGQ3, https://bit.ly/31PHGQ3)shorts: agolde (https://bit.ly/3iBB0Me, more affordable + on sale: https://bit.ly/3gWW3bD)pearl headband: jenn im x 8 other reasons (https://bit.ly/2PS6Ojw)EDITING OUTFITtop (similar: https://bit.ly/2CpUGTP)glasses: wary parker (https://bit.ly/3edb4p1)hair bow: urban outfitters (https://bit.ly/2CG3C7D) FINAL TRY ON CLIPSdress: sewn by me obvs :)butterfly clips (https://amzn.to/3eVZhdv)earrings: jenn im x 8 other reasons (https://bit.ly/2Yf8TuL)✰ BEDROOM DECOR ✰hanging flowers (https://amzn.to/3fYeBXE)bedsheets: urban outfitters (sold out, similar: https://bit.ly/3fWRLQh)pillow cases: urban outfitters (https://bit.ly/3fU1aYV)♫ MUSIC ♫diamonds and pearls by dezaulait (https://soundcloud.com/dezaulait/diamonds-and-pearls)working at the mall + blackberry pie songs by @maxwell.landry on tik toklady by jeff kaale (https://soundcloud.com/jeff-kaale/lady)esquimaux by rogyr (https://soundcloud.com/rogiermuller/esquimaux_ep)just like a child by maxwell young (https://soundcloud.com/maxwell_young/just-like-a-child)flashback by jeff kaale and danny mankind (https://soundcloud.com/dannymankind/flashback-feat-rufflemak-julida-remix-unedited)great days by joakim karud (https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud/great-days)morning by S T H + Jeff Kaale + Jrco (https://soundcloud.com/sadiqthehonest/sadiq-jeff-jrco)STH's youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmw60nuV2rPXzW7NcJhMj8wcharlie brown’s day off by louie zong (https://louiezong.bandcamp.com/track/charlie-browns-day-off) ✰ FAQ ✰what’s your name? ashleywhat’s your instagram? @best.dressedhow old are you? 22 (born in 1998)how tall are you? 5'5what’s your ethnicity? half british and half burmesewhat equipment do you use to film? ➭  main camera: panasonic lumix gh5s (https://amzn.to/2Nb0W1z) ➭  8-18 mm lens (https://amzn.to/3bmVoxd) ➭  12-35mm lens (https://amzn.to/2JiSrz7) ➭  on camera mic: rode videomic pro+ (https://amzn.to/2QHfZBU) ➭  voiceover mic: blue yeti usb mic (https://go.magik.ly/ml/yshp/) ➭  vlog camera: canon g7x mark ii (http://amzn.to/2DfL4cZ) ➭  canon m50 (https://amzn.to/2Dp1bnk) ➭  editing: final cut proFTC: Not sponsored.
