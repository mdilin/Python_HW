About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#arsenal #afc #transfers"

Blurring the lines between narrative and concert film, virtual and reality, Muse’s most theatrical tour to date launches the viewer through a supernatural spectacle, questioning the world around us.Says Drake, “the goal for Simulation Theory was to capture the scale of the electrifying live show and to expand upon its connection to the DNA of the world we built for the past three years in music videos for Muse. In a strange turn, the film’s alternate reality eerily started to mirror our own.”Fans can pre order tickets for the IMAX showings http://imax.com/museThe film has also undergone IMAX’s cutting-edge proprietary Digital Media Re-Mastering (DMR) and sound mixing process to take advantage of the stunning visuals and precision audio of the IMAX® Experience.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Apparently the Secret Service shot a suspect, who was taken to the hospital. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump was abruptly evacuated from a press briefing at the White House on Monday evening after a man who claimed he had a weapon was shot by a U.S. Secret Service officer just outside the White House complex.“There was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person,” Trump told reporters after returning to the White House briefing room about nine minutes after he was asked to leave that room by a Secret Service officer.“It was the suspect that was shot,” Trump added.He said that no one else was injured, but also said that it was his understanding that the suspect had been armed.The shooting took place near the White House fence, Trump said. The Secret Service hours later said that a 51-year-old man approached a Secret Service officer at the officer’s post on 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House complex, and told the officer that he had a weapon.The man then turned and ran toward the officer, withdrawing an object from his clothing, and crouching as if he was about to fire a weapon in a “shooter’s stance,” according to the Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the president and his family.The officer then shot the man, striking him in the torso.The man was immediately given first aid, and Washington, D.C., police and fire units were called to the scene, the Secret Service said.The man and the officer then were taken to George Washington University Hospital.The agency did not answer questions about whether the man actually had a gun, or if the officer was injured, according to NBC News.Nor did the Secret Service identify the man who was shot.But a  law enforcement official told NBC News the man had not been armed with a gun.Trump’s press conference was interrupted almost as soon as it began after an aide approached the president and appeared to tell him that he would have to step outside.Trump followed the aide out of the room and sheltered in the Oval Office, he said.The briefing room was placed on lockdown immediately after the president exited, according to a pool report.When Trump returned, he told reporters the reason he had been ushered out of the room.“I feel very safe with Secret Service, they’re fantastic people, they’re the best of the best, they’re highly trained,” Trump said.Trump said that he was not shaken by the incident. “I don’t know, do I seem rattled?” he said when a reporter asked if he was rattled.“The world has been, you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place.”The president then resumed talking to reporters on the state of the economy after taking questions on the shooting, touting the rising stock market. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Sensible Transfers season begins with Barcelona. A club in political turmoil, with an ageing squad and wage bill which is already far too large, it’s difficult to know where to begin. Or even who will be managing this side next season.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#barcelona #transfers #messi"

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

The internet was brand new and YouTube hadn’t even been thought of yet! I set out making this video to say thank you for two hundred thousand subscribers. But...As I delved into our photo albums it evolved into a story of our lives; hopefully proving that although we have experienced a very positive stint on this planet, life is never plain sailing. The death of my grandmother left undealt trauma and only recently have I truly understood that loss, remembering the beautiful face I loved as a child. The section of video at 2:39 portrays an unfortunate experience at school which led to bullying and ending up a somewhat disturbed child. Discovering fishing soon after was monumental to our progression and it helped the both of us find peace, focus and eventually a career path. I believe nature can help people and that is what drives us to inspire others to get outside with these videos.

By the end of the day, there were 11 golfers within three strokes of the lead heading into Sunday's final round at TPC Harding Park. The first major championship of 2020 has nearly guaranteed a must-see finish with Dustin Johnson holding the 54-hole lead at 9 under while Brooks Koepka, Jason Day, Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau are among those still in striking distance. Of course, established names aren't the only ones in the mix as Scottie Scheffler, Cameron Champ and Collin Morikawa are among those who would love to kickstart their budding careers with a major win on Sunday afternoon in San Francisco. Saturday's round was a tribute to the challenge that TPC Harding Park provides. D.J., Scheffler and Morikawa soared to the top of the leaderboard by posting 65s, but the late-afternoon groups were left grinding through foggy, windy conditions that made scoring difficult. Of the final four pairings on the course only two players, Champ and Koepka, scored under par on Saturday.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#arsenal #afc #transfers"

Pre-order now!From February to October of 2019 MUSE took their Simulation Theory Tour to over 28 countries and played in front of more than 1 MILLION people.  Now fans will be able to experience the spectacle and more,  beginning August 17th when “MUSE - Simulation Theory: The IMAX Experience” will be available exclusively in select IMAX Theaters around the world and  August 21st when the Simulation Theory movie will be available for rent or download on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play (distribution will be via Eagle Rock Entertainment). For more information please go to http://muse.mu/filmConceived and filmed at London’s O2 Arena in September 2019 the film directed by Lance Drake, (who also directed all the promo videos for Simulation Theory album) and Produced by Muse, Pulse Films, Lance Drake, Jesse-Lee Stout and Matthew Bellamy, follows a team of scientists as they investigate the source of a paranormal anomaly appearing around the world. Blurring the lines between narrative and concert film, virtual and reality, Muse’s most theatrical tour to date launches the viewer through a supernatural spectacle, questioning the world around us.Says Drake, “the goal for Simulation Theory was to capture the scale of the electrifying live show and to expand upon its connection to the DNA of the world we built for the past three years in music videos for Muse. In a strange turn, the film’s alternate reality eerily started to mirror our own.”Fans can pre order tickets for the IMAX showings http://imax.com/museThe film has also undergone IMAX’s cutting-edge proprietary Digital Media Re-Mastering (DMR) and sound mixing process to take advantage of the stunning visuals and precision audio of the IMAX® Experience. In IMAX, MUSE fans will be immersed in a cinematic world  of unmatched scope and clarity, surrounded by next-generation precision audio that delivers pitch-perfect tuning and pin-point accuracy in custom-designed IMAX theatres.Theater safety measures will comply with governmental and exhibitor guidelines. Examples of typical measures taken may include but are not limited to use of masks by employees, social distancing and capacity constraints, as well as increased sanitation efforts. Please contact your local exhibitor for more information on their specific precautions.Available for pre order on the same day will be 2 different limited edition deluxe box sets which will be available via muse.mu and physical retail. To celebrate the release of the Deluxe box sets, MUSE also teamed up with Marvel Comics to create and release a custom Simulation Theory comic book and limited-edition poster."

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Apparently the Secret Service shot a suspect, who was taken to the hospital. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump was abruptly evacuated from a press briefing at the White House on Monday evening after a man who claimed he had a weapon was shot by a U.S. Secret Service officer just outside the White House complex.“There was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person,” Trump told reporters after returning to the White House briefing room about nine minutes after he was asked to leave that room by a Secret Service officer.“It was the suspect that was shot,” Trump added.He said that no one else was injured, but also said that it was his understanding that the suspect had been armed.The shooting took place near the White House fence, Trump said. The Secret Service hours later said that a 51-year-old man approached a Secret Service officer at the officer’s post on 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House complex, and told the officer that he had a weapon.The man then turned and ran toward the officer, withdrawing an object from his clothing, and crouching as if he was about to fire a weapon in a “shooter’s stance,” according to the Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the president and his family.The officer then shot the man, striking him in the torso.The man was immediately given first aid, and Washington, D.C., police and fire units were called to the scene, the Secret Service said.The man and the officer then were taken to George Washington University Hospital.The agency did not answer questions about whether the man actually had a gun, or if the officer was injured, according to NBC News.Nor did the Secret Service identify the man who was shot.But a  law enforcement official told NBC News the man had not been armed with a gun.Trump’s press conference was interrupted almost as soon as it began after an aide approached the president and appeared to tell him that he would have to step outside.Trump followed the aide out of the room and sheltered in the Oval Office, he said.The briefing room was placed on lockdown immediately after the president exited, according to a pool report.When Trump returned, he told reporters the reason he had been ushered out of the room.“I feel very safe with Secret Service, they’re fantastic people, they’re the best of the best, they’re highly trained,” Trump said.Trump said that he was not shaken by the incident. “I don’t know, do I seem rattled?” he said when a reporter asked if he was rattled.“The world has been, you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place.”The president then resumed talking to reporters on the state of the economy after taking questions on the shooting, touting the rising stock market. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Discretion advised. The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

The internet was brand new and YouTube hadn’t even been thought of yet! I set out making this video to say thank you for two hundred thousand subscribers. But...As I delved into our photo albums it evolved into a story of our lives; hopefully proving that although we have experienced a very positive stint on this planet, life is never plain sailing. The death of my grandmother left undealt trauma and only recently have I truly understood that loss, remembering the beautiful face I loved as a child. The section of video at 2:39 portrays an unfortunate experience at school which led to bullying and ending up a somewhat disturbed child. Discovering fishing soon after was monumental to our progression and it helped the both of us find peace, focus and eventually a career path. I believe nature can help people and that is what drives us to inspire others to get outside with these videos. YouTube has been our ‘thing’ now for over 13 years, and we can’t quite believe the joy and excitement it has brought us, especially since leaving our jobs and going full time. Feel free to click subscribe and join our journey be it fishing, aquatics, adventures or gardening. The future is brighter than the past ever was!

By the end of the day, there were 11 golfers within three strokes of the lead heading into Sunday's final round at TPC Harding Park. The first major championship of 2020 has nearly guaranteed a must-see finish with Dustin Johnson holding the 54-hole lead at 9 under while Brooks Koepka, Jason Day, Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau are among those still in striking distance. Of course, established names aren't the only ones in the mix as Scottie Scheffler, Cameron Champ and Collin Morikawa are among those who would love to kickstart their budding careers with a major win on Sunday afternoon in San Francisco. Saturday's round was a tribute to the challenge that TPC Harding Park provides. D.J., Scheffler and Morikawa soared to the top of the leaderboard by posting 65s, but the late-afternoon groups were left grinding through foggy, windy conditions that made scoring difficult. Of the final four pairings on the course only two players, Champ and Koepka, scored under par on Saturday.

Willian started at Brazilian side Corinthians, before joining Shakhtar Donetsk in August 2007. In his six years there, he won four Ukrainian Premier League titles and the Uefa Cup in 2009. Four years later, he briefly signed for Anzhi Makhachkala before joining Chelsea, winning the Premier League and League Cup in his second season in England. Throughout his seven years at Chelsea, he won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and the Europa League. He made 339 appearances, with 63 goals and 56 assists in that time. “I believe he’s a player that can really make a difference for us, Mikel Arteta said. We have been monitoring him for the past few months, we had a clear intention to strengthen in the attacking midfielder and the winger positions [and] he is a player that gives us a lot of versatility, he can play in three or four different positions. He has the experience of everything in the football world but to still have the ambition to come here and contribute to bring the club where it belongs. I have been really impressed with all the talks I have had with him and how much he wanted to come.”  Willian has made 70 appearances and has scored nine goals for Brazil, making his international debut in 2011. He has since represented his country at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, the 2015 Copa America, the Copa America Centenario, and the 2019 Copa America where he was a key member of the squad that lifted the trophy on home soil. Technical director Edu said: “I know him very well, since a long time ago because we've been working together for the Brazilian national team and of course I was following him because he played for another club. He has a lot of fantastic attributes as a person, as a football player of course, his character. I'm 100 per cent sure that everybody in the dressing room, the fans, myself and Mikel will enjoy having Willian in our side.“ Willian will wear the number 12 shirt.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#arsenal #afc #transfers"

Pre-order now!From February to October of 2019 MUSE took their Simulation Theory Tour to over 28 countries and played in front of more than 1 MILLION people.  Now fans will be able to experience the spectacle and more,  beginning August 17th when “MUSE - Simulation Theory: The IMAX Experience” will be available exclusively in select IMAX Theaters around the world and  August 21st when the Simulation Theory movie will be available for rent or download on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play (distribution will be via Eagle Rock Entertainment).

Blurring the lines between narrative and concert film, virtual and reality, Muse’s most theatrical tour to date launches the viewer through a supernatural spectacle, questioning the world around us.Says Drake, “the goal for Simulation Theory was to capture the scale of the electrifying live show and to expand upon its connection to the DNA of the world we built for the past three years in music videos for Muse. In a strange turn, the film’s alternate reality eerily started to mirror our own.”Fans can pre order tickets for the IMAX showings http://imax.com/museThe film has also undergone IMAX’s cutting-edge proprietary Digital Media Re-Mastering (DMR) and sound mixing process to take advantage of the stunning visuals and precision audio of the IMAX® Experience. In IMAX, MUSE fans will be immersed in a cinematic world  of unmatched scope and clarity, surrounded by next-generation precision audio that delivers pitch-perfect tuning and pin-point accuracy in custom-designed IMAX theatres.Theater safety measures will comply with governmental and exhibitor guidelines. Examples of typical measures taken may include but are not limited to use of masks by employees, social distancing and capacity constraints, as well as increased sanitation efforts.

To celebrate the release of the Deluxe box sets, MUSE also teamed up with Marvel Comics to create and release a custom Simulation Theory comic book and limited-edition poster."

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Apparently the Secret Service shot a suspect, who was taken to the hospital. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump was abruptly evacuated from a press briefing at the White House on Monday evening after a man who claimed he had a weapon was shot by a U.S. Secret Service officer just outside the White House complex.“There was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person,” Trump told reporters after returning to the White House briefing room about nine minutes after he was asked to leave that room by a Secret Service officer.“It was the suspect that was shot,” Trump added.He said that no one else was injured, but also said that it was his understanding that the suspect had been armed.The shooting took place near the White House fence, Trump said. The Secret Service hours later said that a 51-year-old man approached a Secret Service officer at the officer’s post on 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House complex, and told the officer that he had a weapon.The man then turned and ran toward the officer, withdrawing an object from his clothing, and crouching as if he was about to fire a weapon in a “shooter’s stance,” according to the Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the president and his family.The officer then shot the man, striking him in the torso.The man was immediately given first aid, and Washington, D.C., police and fire units were called to the scene, the Secret Service said.The man and the officer then were taken to George Washington University Hospital.The agency did not answer questions about whether the man actually had a gun, or if the officer was injured, according to NBC News.Nor did the Secret Service identify the man who was shot.But a  law enforcement official told NBC News the man had not been armed with a gun.Trump’s press conference was interrupted almost as soon as it began after an aide approached the president and appeared to tell him that he would have to step outside.Trump followed the aide out of the room and sheltered in the Oval Office, he said.The briefing room was placed on lockdown immediately after the president exited, according to a pool report.When Trump returned, he told reporters the reason he had been ushered out of the room.“I feel very safe with Secret Service, they’re fantastic people, they’re the best of the best, they’re highly trained,” Trump said.Trump said that he was not shaken by the incident. “I don’t know, do I seem rattled?” he said when a reporter asked if he was rattled.“The world has been, you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place.”The president then resumed talking to reporters on the state of the economy after taking questions on the shooting, touting the rising stock market. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

Discretion advised. The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

Sensible Transfers season begins with Barcelona. A club in political turmoil, with an ageing squad and wage bill which is already far too large, it’s difficult to know where to begin. Or even who will be managing this side next season.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

The internet was brand new and YouTube hadn’t even been thought of yet! I set out making this video to say thank you for two hundred thousand subscribers. But...As I delved into our photo albums it evolved into a story of our lives; hopefully proving that although we have experienced a very positive stint on this planet, life is never plain sailing. The death of my grandmother left undealt trauma and only recently have I truly understood that loss, remembering the beautiful face I loved as a child. The section of video at 2:39 portrays an unfortunate experience at school which led to bullying and ending up a somewhat disturbed child. Discovering fishing soon after was monumental to our progression and it helped the both of us find peace, focus and eventually a career path. I believe nature can help people and that is what drives us to inspire others to get outside with these videos.

The ESPN FC crew of Craig Burley, Julien Laurens and Frank Leboeuf join Kay Murray to delve deeper into the match and assess what exactly went wrong for the La Liga side.

Willian started at Brazilian side Corinthians, before joining Shakhtar Donetsk in August 2007. In his six years there, he won four Ukrainian Premier League titles and the Uefa Cup in 2009. Four years later, he briefly signed for Anzhi Makhachkala before joining Chelsea, winning the Premier League and League Cup in his second season in England. Throughout his seven years at Chelsea, he won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and the Europa League. He made 339 appearances, with 63 goals and 56 assists in that time. “I believe he’s a player that can really make a difference for us, Mikel Arteta said. We have been monitoring him for the past few months, we had a clear intention to strengthen in the attacking midfielder and the winger positions [and] he is a player that gives us a lot of versatility, he can play in three or four different positions. He has the experience of everything in the football world but to still have the ambition to come here and contribute to bring the club where it belongs. I have been really impressed with all the talks I have had with him and how much he wanted to come.”  Willian has made 70 appearances and has scored nine goals for Brazil, making his international debut in 2011. He has since represented his country at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, the 2015 Copa America, the Copa America Centenario, and the 2019 Copa America where he was a key member of the squad that lifted the trophy on home soil. Technical director Edu said: “I know him very well, since a long time ago because we've been working together for the Brazilian national team and of course I was following him because he played for another club. He has a lot of fantastic attributes as a person, as a football player of course, his character. I'm 100 per cent sure that everybody in the dressing room, the fans, myself and Mikel will enjoy having Willian in our side.“ Willian will wear the number 12 shirt.

HarveyModel Shae McmanusDemon Scott MonkIntro:I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretWhat the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?When there's nothin' left...Cause I don't wanna feel shit, someone must've hit a kill switchThey don't ask about the problems that I deal withFuck all of this money you can have it I don't feel richI keep havin' these flashbacks I hate 'emThey remind me of my problems, I can't stand to face 'emI know it's prolly my last to change 'emBut even if I do it my past can't erase itThey recognize me 'cause they see me on the internetThey think I owe 'em somethin' I can't deal with all the disrespectSick to my stomach, when I feel it I just disconnectMy demons tend get the best of me when I get depressedI've been stabbed in the back with a chainsawBut who am I to blame y'all, I'm smokin 'til the pain's goneYou see me smilin on the surface tryna stay strongActin' like I'm happy starts to feel like it's my day jobBut just as long as there's a purpose to it allI'll keep tourin workin' hard, writin verses to these songsFar from perfect, every person has their flawsAnd mine is I'm an addict still searchin for a causeI know they judge me for mistakes that I've madeSince I've gained all this fame shit just ain't been the sameI came in the game to pave a lane for my nameAnd it's painful to say it put's restraints on my brain butI know it's worth it cause I get to tell my storyI'm at a point where the industry can't ignore meI never had the main stream media to endorse meI did this all by me and myself and y'all are cornyTo every kid that's listenin to this songI hope you've found the message I've written within it allIf no one's ever there to pick you up when you fallI promise you're not alone, play this shit and just hit the wall 'causeI've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI know you listenin' for somethin' to relate toI know the feelin' like the whole world hates youI know you wishin' you could finally have a breakthroughYou thought it was a phase so you pretend you're in a great moodI know it hurts to see reflections of yourself'Cause the person that you see is not like everybody elseSo you try and you try but it never seems to helpSo you're questionin' your words 'cause you're so fed up with the guiltBut...You're not the only one that's goin' through regretYou're not the only one that no one seems to getYou're not the only one that's so close to the edgeAnd if you slip it's over for you so you cope with it insteadI can promise you that nobody is perfect and you overthink the little shit you're always so concerned withSo you lock yourself inside everynight and close the curtainsAnd you're screamin' out loud but it's like no one even heard itI know problems keep pilin' up right in front of youSo much anxiety inside you don't know what to doBeen lied to so much you that you don't think you even want the truthFuck it, aww you grew to be used it, it ain't nothin' newI been there too, just hold tightA lot of substance abuse and long nightsBut next time I see all my demons it's on sightNext time I see all my demons it's on sight yeah....I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#arsenal #afc #transfers"

Pre-order now!From February to October of 2019 MUSE took their Simulation Theory Tour to over 28 countries and played in front of more than 1 MILLION people.  Now fans will be able to experience the spectacle and more,  beginning August 17th when “MUSE - Simulation Theory: The IMAX Experience” will be available exclusively in select IMAX Theaters around the world and  August 21st when the Simulation Theory movie will be available for rent or download on iTunes, Amazon and Google Play (distribution will be via Eagle Rock Entertainment). For more information please go to http://muse.mu/filmConceived and filmed at London’s O2 Arena in September 2019 the film directed by Lance Drake, (who also directed all the promo videos for Simulation Theory album) and Produced by Muse, Pulse Films, Lance Drake, Jesse-Lee Stout and Matthew Bellamy, follows a team of scientists as they investigate the source of a paranormal anomaly appearing around the world. Blurring the lines between narrative and concert film, virtual and reality, Muse’s most theatrical tour to date launches the viewer through a supernatural spectacle, questioning the world around us.Says Drake, “the goal for Simulation Theory was to capture the scale of the electrifying live show and to expand upon its connection to the DNA of the world we built for the past three years in music videos for Muse. In a strange turn, the film’s alternate reality eerily started to mirror our own.”Fans can pre order tickets for the IMAX showings http://imax.com/museThe film has also undergone IMAX’s cutting-edge proprietary Digital Media Re-Mastering (DMR) and sound mixing process to take advantage of the stunning visuals and precision audio of the IMAX® Experience. In IMAX, MUSE fans will be immersed in a cinematic world  of unmatched scope and clarity, surrounded by next-generation precision audio that delivers pitch-perfect tuning and pin-point accuracy in custom-designed IMAX theatres.Theater safety measures will comply with governmental and exhibitor guidelines. Examples of typical measures taken may include but are not limited to use of masks by employees, social distancing and capacity constraints, as well as increased sanitation efforts. Please contact your local exhibitor for more information on their specific precautions.Available for pre order on the same day will be 2 different limited edition deluxe box sets which will be available via muse.mu and physical retail. To celebrate the release of the Deluxe box sets, MUSE also teamed up with Marvel Comics to create and release a custom Simulation Theory comic book and limited-edition poster."

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke."

Apparently the Secret Service shot a suspect, who was taken to the hospital. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi President Donald Trump was abruptly evacuated from a press briefing at the White House on Monday evening after a man who claimed he had a weapon was shot by a U.S. Secret Service officer just outside the White House complex.“There was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person,” Trump told reporters after returning to the White House briefing room about nine minutes after he was asked to leave that room by a Secret Service officer.“It was the suspect that was shot,” Trump added.He said that no one else was injured, but also said that it was his understanding that the suspect had been armed.The shooting took place near the White House fence, Trump said. The Secret Service hours later said that a 51-year-old man approached a Secret Service officer at the officer’s post on 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House complex, and told the officer that he had a weapon.The man then turned and ran toward the officer, withdrawing an object from his clothing, and crouching as if he was about to fire a weapon in a “shooter’s stance,” according to the Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the president and his family.The officer then shot the man, striking him in the torso.The man was immediately given first aid, and Washington, D.C., police and fire units were called to the scene, the Secret Service said.The man and the officer then were taken to George Washington University Hospital.The agency did not answer questions about whether the man actually had a gun, or if the officer was injured, according to NBC News.Nor did the Secret Service identify the man who was shot.But a  law enforcement official told NBC News the man had not been armed with a gun.Trump’s press conference was interrupted almost as soon as it began after an aide approached the president and appeared to tell him that he would have to step outside.Trump followed the aide out of the room and sheltered in the Oval Office, he said.The briefing room was placed on lockdown immediately after the president exited, according to a pool report.When Trump returned, he told reporters the reason he had been ushered out of the room.“I feel very safe with Secret Service, they’re fantastic people, they’re the best of the best, they’re highly trained,” Trump said.Trump said that he was not shaken by the incident. “I don’t know, do I seem rattled?” he said when a reporter asked if he was rattled.“The world has been, you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place.”The president then resumed talking to reporters on the state of the economy after taking questions on the shooting, touting the rising stock market. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

In the case of UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic's rubber match with Daniel Cormier at UFC 252, however, the third meeting surpassed anything that happened in the first two bouts as Miocic managed to outwork Cormier over five rounds for a unanimous decision victory in a thrilling battle.The hype train of rising bantamweight Sugar Sean O'Malley took a detour on its trip toward crossover stardom after an apparent leg injury led to an opportunistic finish from Marlon Chito Vera on Saturday.The first round and a half of the UFC 252 heavyweight clash between Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Junior dos Santos belonged to dos Santos, but Rozenstruik proved once again that it only takes one of his shots to turn a fight, scoring a TKO in the second round to rebound from a devastating loss in his last outing.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC252 #Miocic #Cormier #UFC #MMA #SugarSeanOMalley #ChitoVera #Rozenstruik #JuniorDosSantos"

I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can be…to say the least!I personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.On YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I don’t know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isn’t as flexible as it once was or you’ve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are I’ve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.Be prepared though.

Willian started at Brazilian side Corinthians, before joining Shakhtar Donetsk in August 2007. In his six years there, he won four Ukrainian Premier League titles and the Uefa Cup in 2009. Four years later, he briefly signed for Anzhi Makhachkala before joining Chelsea, winning the Premier League and League Cup in his second season in England. Throughout his seven years at Chelsea, he won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and the Europa League. He made 339 appearances, with 63 goals and 56 assists in that time. “I believe he’s a player that can really make a difference for us, Mikel Arteta said. We have been monitoring him for the past few months, we had a clear intention to strengthen in the attacking midfielder and the winger positions [and] he is a player that gives us a lot of versatility, he can play in three or four different positions. He has the experience of everything in the football world but to still have the ambition to come here and contribute to bring the club where it belongs. I have been really impressed with all the talks I have had with him and how much he wanted to come.”  Willian has made 70 appearances and has scored nine goals for Brazil, making his international debut in 2011. He has since represented his country at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, the 2015 Copa America, the Copa America Centenario, and the 2019 Copa America where he was a key member of the squad that lifted the trophy on home soil. Technical director Edu said: “I know him very well, since
