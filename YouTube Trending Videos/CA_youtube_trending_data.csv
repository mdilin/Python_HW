It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Wallace overreacted sometimes and complained plenty, but he wasn't merely a whiner. Fair or not, Sheed detected, and sought to call out, bias among the NBA's refs. He's far from the only person to suggest that refs get emotional, play favorites, or bring ulterior motives to the court. He is, however, one of the players to make that point on the court. He made it consistently and boldly, and in a way that drew extra ire from the very refs he accused of targeting him. In short, this was a crusade that turned a typically-tense relationship into outright beef. While he played, it was Sheed vs. Basically Every Ref. And even in retirement, Wallace is not done fighting that battle.Edited by Ryan SimmonsWritten and produced by Seth RosenthalSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

"MKHriv5r8pk","Meet Kohl (Date #3) | Brooklyn's 10 DATES in 10 DAYS","2020-08-10T21:04:32Z","UC6QWhGQqf0YDYdRb0n6ojWw","Brooklyn and Bailey","24","2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","[None]","605678","28828","315","4955","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MKHriv5r8pk/default.jpg","False","False","Brooklyn is going on TEN DATES in TEN DAYS! (This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos. You can check those out here!💥 Identical Twins Switch Places | Will Bailey’s Boyfriend Notice?

J'ai 24h pour construire la plus gross piscine du monde avec comme matériaux principal: du carton!➡️  Rejoins la famille en t'abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.✌️➡️  La suite de l'aventure sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Qui n'a jamais rêvé d'avoir une piscine chez soi, dans son jardin? Il y a quelques semaines, j'ai essayé de reproduire des tutoriels et astuces tiktok spécial été, pour cheveux et astuces culinaires dans ma cuisine. Cette semaine, j'ai relevé le défii, en moins de 24h top chrono, de construire une piscine en carton chez moi! Le tutoriel: https://youtu.be/CsAxyxDOAS0Le projet m'a couté moins de 80$ (60€), et la piscine a vraiment bien tenue! J'ai adoré réaliser ce défi 24h dans la piscine, surtout que le projet construction a été hyper facile à réaliser, sans compétences nécessaire, un peu de bois, du scotch (pas le scotch scolaire mais celui pour construire des objets, faire du diy), et surtout du carton. Il y a plusieurs vidéos tutoriel sur YouTube qui montrent les meilleurs diy a faire avec du carton: des tables de billards, des arbres à chat, des meubles pour produits de beauté: comme des portes pinceaux à maquillage, des décorations pour la chambre, mais aussi pour faire des costumes, déguisements/cosplay pour fabriquer des objets facile d’utilisation quotidien. J’ai adoré réaliser cette sculpture en carton dans mon jardin, au milieu de mes plantes 🌱 et fleurs! J’ai maintenant un beau petit patio, une belle terrasse de jardin avec ma piscine en bois et en carton pour profiter de l’été. Vive les summer hacks! J’avais vu passer des astuces d’activités manuelles du genre sur TikTok, pour apprendre à faire les meilleures astuces culinaires, pour nous montrer comment réaliser les meilleures rénovations à la maison quand on est débutant, dans sa salle de bain, dans sa cuisine ou encore dans sa chambre.Au final, j’ai trouvé que cette activité manuelle avec du cardboard était hyper facile à réaliser. Il faut un plan bien construit, un plan bien pensé, des outils comme un marteau, des vis, une perceuse de chez Black et Decker, Dewalt ou encore makita, une agrafeuse avec des agrafes stanley, des rouleaux de scotch et biensûr du carton! Avis à tous les bricoleurs et toutes les bricoleuses, cette astuce bricolage pour la piscine est vraiment facile et très pratique. C’est comme si j’avais passé 24h dans un carton ou 24h dans ma piscine 😂 ça m’a prit quasiment 8h pour bricoler et construire cette piscine dans mon jardin de ville. Alors si vous vous demandez comment construire la piscine de vos rêves ou encore comment réaliser un record du monde, sortie de votre zone de confort et devenir le meilleur bricoleur de tous les temps, suivez le tutoriel diy spécial été 😂Je vous promet, pour cet été, pas besoin de piscine gonflable ou encore de trouver les meilleurs endroits de la région pour aller se baigner avec la chaleur et la canicule, pour lutter comme le chaud et le beau soleil qui brille, enfilez un jean 👖 et en route pour l’aventure et pour construire la piscine en carton de vos rêves. Je vous jure, c’est le meilleur diy avec du carton, le tuto déco idéal pour sa maison ou son appartement, sur son balcon, sa terrasse ou son jardin! Bref, un diy facile à réaliser en famille et entre amis!On dirait presque un tuto minecraft, vous ne trouvez pas?

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

Sensible Transfers season begins with Barcelona. A club in political turmoil, with an ageing squad and wage bill which is already far too large, it’s difficult to know where to begin. Or even who will be managing this side next season.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#barcelona #transfers #messi"

At 230 square feet, it was designed for 1 or 2 people to live in, and what’s really unique about it is that it can easily be attached and detached from a trailer which offers several advantages over a traditional tiny house on wheels: it means you don't have to build around wheel wells, it saves money because the foundation system is a third of the cost of a trailer, and it makes the tiny house more durable because the trailer is the part that could rust or need replacing before the other building materials do.One of the goals with this tiny house was to make it feel open and spacious, so there is no loft or bedroom in this house, instead they have a large couch that doubles as a bed, and can be extended into a Queen-size bed if two people live here.  The couch has storage for the bedding inside it, so the bed can be quickly made up and put away each day.It has a surprising amount of storage with the full sized closet and lots of kitchen cabinets and drawers.  It also has a flex space that could be a desk or a dining table, and a very spacious bathroom at the back.The home is heated with an in-floor heating system, and it has a ceiling fan and plenty of windows to circulate air.  There is also room to add a ductless mini split for A/C if someone wanted to add that in.You can follow and find out more about True North Tiny Homes here:https://www.truenorthtinyhomes.ca/https://www.instagram.com/truenorthtinyhomes/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6hJR5UdiWGCQICPNBfuHgAnd here is another beautiful True North Tiny Homes model that we filmed in 2019:https://youtu.be/_Z-z6JCcXWEThe Nest was designed as a prototype for a non-profit called Creating Roots, that aims to provide housing for foster youth who are aging out of the system.

Discretion advised. The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

"uhZE84C5g0M","Meet Matt (Date #4) | Brooklyn's 10 Dates in 10 Days","2020-08-12T21:00:30Z","UC6QWhGQqf0YDYdRb0n6ojWw","Brooklyn and Bailey","24","2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","[None]","452434","21300","345","4742","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uhZE84C5g0M/default.jpg","False","False","Brooklyn is going on 10 DATES in 10 DAYS! (This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Matt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Growing up, I was always going back and forth between several signature scents based on my mood, the occasion, my outfit. As an adult I felt like I was “supposed” to settle more on one fragrance, and often became bored with my choice. I love that this fragrance collection is truly not just for many types of women, but for the different personalities and roles that women have from one day to the next. With so many decisions to make every day as an actor, an entrepreneur and now a mom, I love the idea that Cacharel not only offers fragrances for the multi-faceted modern woman, but that this collection caters to the many, many roles that women play in today’s society by offering a variety of fragrances to suit every moment.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Wallace overreacted sometimes and complained plenty, but he wasn't merely a whiner. Fair or not, Sheed detected, and sought to call out, bias among the NBA's refs. He's far from the only person to suggest that refs get emotional, play favorites, or bring ulterior motives to the court. He is, however, one of the players to make that point on the court. He made it consistently and boldly, and in a way that drew extra ire from the very refs he accused of targeting him. In short, this was a crusade that turned a typically-tense relationship into outright beef. While he played, it was Sheed vs. Basically Every Ref. And even in retirement, Wallace is not done fighting that battle.Edited by Ryan SimmonsWritten and produced by Seth RosenthalSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

J'ai 24h pour construire la plus gross piscine du monde avec comme matériaux principal: du carton!➡️  Rejoins la famille en t'abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.✌️➡️  La suite de l'aventure sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Qui n'a jamais rêvé d'avoir une piscine chez soi, dans son jardin? Il y a quelques semaines, j'ai essayé de reproduire des tutoriels et astuces tiktok spécial été, pour cheveux et astuces culinaires dans ma cuisine. Cette semaine, j'ai relevé le défii, en moins de 24h top chrono, de construire une piscine en carton chez moi! Le tutoriel: https://youtu.be/CsAxyxDOAS0Le projet m'a couté moins de 80$ (60€), et la piscine a vraiment bien tenue! J'ai adoré réaliser ce défi 24h dans la piscine, surtout que le projet construction a été hyper facile à réaliser, sans compétences nécessaire, un peu de bois, du scotch (pas le scotch scolaire mais celui pour construire des objets, faire du diy), et surtout du carton. Il y a plusieurs vidéos tutoriel sur YouTube qui montrent les meilleurs diy a faire avec du carton: des tables de billards, des arbres à chat, des meubles pour produits de beauté: comme des portes pinceaux à maquillage, des décorations pour la chambre, mais aussi pour faire des costumes, déguisements/cosplay pour fabriquer des objets facile d’utilisation quotidien. J’ai adoré réaliser cette sculpture en carton dans mon jardin, au milieu de mes plantes 🌱 et fleurs! J’ai maintenant un beau petit patio, une belle terrasse de jardin avec ma piscine en bois et en carton pour profiter de l’été. Vive les summer hacks! J’avais vu passer des astuces d’activités manuelles du genre sur TikTok, pour apprendre à faire les meilleures astuces culinaires, pour nous montrer comment réaliser les meilleures rénovations à la maison quand on est débutant, dans sa salle de bain, dans sa cuisine ou encore dans sa chambre.Au final, j’ai trouvé que cette activité manuelle avec du cardboard était hyper facile à réaliser. Il faut un plan bien construit, un plan bien pensé, des outils comme un marteau, des vis, une perceuse de chez Black et Decker, Dewalt ou encore makita, une agrafeuse avec des agrafes stanley, des rouleaux de scotch et biensûr du carton! Avis à tous les bricoleurs et toutes les bricoleuses, cette astuce bricolage pour la piscine est vraiment facile et très pratique. C’est comme si j’avais passé 24h dans un carton ou 24h dans ma piscine 😂 ça m’a prit quasiment 8h pour bricoler et construire cette piscine dans mon jardin de ville. Alors si vous vous demandez comment construire la piscine de vos rêves ou encore comment réaliser un record du monde, sortie de votre zone de confort et devenir le meilleur bricoleur de tous les temps, suivez le tutoriel diy spécial été 😂Je vous promet, pour cet été, pas besoin de piscine gonflable ou encore de trouver les meilleurs endroits de la région pour aller se baigner avec la chaleur et la canicule, pour lutter comme le chaud et le beau soleil qui brille, enfilez un jean 👖 et en route pour l’aventure et pour construire la piscine en carton de vos rêves. Je vous jure, c’est le meilleur diy avec du carton, le tuto déco idéal pour sa maison ou son appartement, sur son balcon, sa terrasse ou son jardin! Bref, un diy facile à réaliser en famille et entre amis!On dirait presque un tuto minecraft, vous ne trouvez pas? On dirait que je suis dans un jeu-vidéo et que j’ai réalisé la meilleure piscine possible dans les sims 4, ou encore dans Fortnite 😂😂 sauf qu’on est pas du tout sur une console de jeu vidéo du genre PlayStation, Xbox ou encore PC, mais bel et bien dans la vraie vie.Vidéo de DENYZEECette chaîne est une chaîne youtube de divertissement et d'humour.

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos. You can check those out here!💥 Identical Twins Switch Places | Will Bailey’s Boyfriend Notice?

Sensible Transfers season begins with Barcelona. A club in political turmoil, with an ageing squad and wage bill which is already far too large, it’s difficult to know where to begin. Or even who will be managing this side next season.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#barcelona #transfers #messi"

The moment of the massive explosion that rocked the Lebanese capital Beirut, killing more than 137 people and injuring thousands, was captured in high definition by a shop owner who was recording when the blast hit.Video shows smoke rising from Beirut's port with small sparks being seen in what is believed to be fireworks that were set off by the blaze. According to reports, fireworks were stored in the same warehouse where 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate had previously been stored. After several seconds of recording, a massive explosion bursts outwards, which then moves outwards towards where the shop owner is, the resulting shockwave impacting multiple buildings in the process.For more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/7256905/beirut-explosion-map-canada-cities/

At 230 square feet, it was designed for 1 or 2 people to live in, and what’s really unique about it is that it can easily be attached and detached from a trailer which offers several advantages over a traditional tiny house on wheels: it means you don't have to build around wheel wells, it saves money because the foundation system is a third of the cost of a trailer, and it makes the tiny house more durable because the trailer is the part that could rust or need replacing before the other building materials do.One of the goals with this tiny house was to make it feel open and spacious, so there is no loft or bedroom in this house, instead they have a large couch that doubles as a bed, and can be extended into a Queen-size bed if two people live here.  The couch has storage for the bedding inside it, so the bed can be quickly made up and put away each day.It has a surprising amount of storage with the full sized closet and lots of kitchen cabinets and drawers.  It also has a flex space that could be a desk or a dining table, and a very spacious bathroom at the back.The home is heated with an in-floor heating system, and it has a ceiling fan and plenty of windows to circulate air.  There is also room to add a ductless mini split for A/C if someone wanted to add that in.You can follow and find out more about True North Tiny Homes here:https://www.truenorthtinyhomes.ca/https://www.instagram.com/truenorthtinyhomes/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6hJR5UdiWGCQICPNBfuHgAnd here is another beautiful True North Tiny Homes model that we filmed in 2019:https://youtu.be/_Z-z6JCcXWEThe Nest was designed as a prototype for a non-profit called Creating Roots, that aims to provide housing for foster youth who are aging out of the system.

HarveyModel Shae McmanusDemon Scott MonkIntro:I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretWhat the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?What the fuck am I to do?When there's nothin' left...Cause I don't wanna feel shit, someone must've hit a kill switchThey don't ask about the problems that I deal withFuck all of this money you can have it I don't feel richI keep havin' these flashbacks I hate 'emThey remind me of my problems, I can't stand to face 'emI know it's prolly my last to change 'emBut even if I do it my past can't erase itThey recognize me 'cause they see me on the internetThey think I owe 'em somethin' I can't deal with all the disrespectSick to my stomach, when I feel it I just disconnectMy demons tend get the best of me when I get depressedI've been stabbed in the back with a chainsawBut who am I to blame y'all, I'm smokin 'til the pain's goneYou see me smilin on the surface tryna stay strongActin' like I'm happy starts to feel like it's my day jobBut just as long as there's a purpose to it allI'll keep tourin workin' hard, writin verses to these songsFar from perfect, every person has their flawsAnd mine is I'm an addict still searchin for a causeI know they judge me for mistakes that I've madeSince I've gained all this fame shit just ain't been the sameI came in the game to pave a lane for my nameAnd it's painful to say it put's restraints on my brain butI know it's worth it cause I get to tell my storyI'm at a point where the industry can't ignore meI never had the main stream media to endorse meI did this all by me and myself and y'all are cornyTo every kid that's listenin to this songI hope you've found the message I've written within it allIf no one's ever there to pick you up when you fallI promise you're not alone, play this shit and just hit the wall 'causeI've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI know you listenin' for somethin' to relate toI know the feelin' like the whole world hates youI know you wishin' you could finally have a breakthroughYou thought it was a phase so you pretend you're in a great moodI know it hurts to see reflections of yourself'Cause the person that you see is not like everybody elseSo you try and you try but it never seems to helpSo you're questionin' your words 'cause you're so fed up with the guiltBut...You're not the only one that's goin' through regretYou're not the only one that no one seems to getYou're not the only one that's so close to the edgeAnd if you slip it's over for you so you cope with it insteadI can promise you that nobody is perfect and you overthink the little shit you're always so concerned withSo you lock yourself inside everynight and close the curtainsAnd you're screamin' out loud but it's like no one even heard itI know problems keep pilin' up right in front of youSo much anxiety inside you don't know what to doBeen lied to so much you that you don't think you even want the truthFuck it, aww you grew to be used it, it ain't nothin' newI been there too, just hold tightA lot of substance abuse and long nightsBut next time I see all my demons it's on sightNext time I see all my demons it's on sight yeah....I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey keep talkin' to me but I can't tell 'em shit 'cause they can't keep a secretI've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey been hauntin' my dreams and I can't think straight 'cause they won't stop screamin'I've been fallin' asleep with, all of my demonsThey

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Matt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Growing up, I was always going back and forth between several signature scents based on my mood, the occasion, my outfit. As an adult I felt like I was “supposed” to settle more on one fragrance, and often became bored with my choice. I love that this fragrance collection is truly not just for many types of women, but for the different personalities and roles that women have from one day to the next. With so many decisions to make every day as an actor, an entrepreneur and now a mom, I love the idea that Cacharel not only offers fragrances for the multi-faceted modern woman, but that this collection caters to the many, many roles that women play in today’s society by offering a variety of fragrances to suit every moment.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Wallace overreacted sometimes and complained plenty, but he wasn't merely a whiner. Fair or not, Sheed detected, and sought to call out, bias among the NBA's refs. He's far from the only person to suggest that refs get emotional, play favorites, or bring ulterior motives to the court. He is, however, one of the players to make that point on the court. He made it consistently and boldly, and in a way that drew extra ire from the very refs he accused of targeting him. In short, this was a crusade that turned a typically-tense relationship into outright beef. While he played, it was Sheed vs. Basically Every Ref. And even in retirement, Wallace is not done fighting that battle.Edited by Ryan SimmonsWritten and produced by Seth RosenthalSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

J'ai 24h pour construire la plus gross piscine du monde avec comme matériaux principal: du carton!➡️  Rejoins la famille en t'abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.✌️➡️  La suite de l'aventure sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Qui n'a jamais rêvé d'avoir une piscine chez soi, dans son jardin? Il y a quelques semaines, j'ai essayé de reproduire des tutoriels et astuces tiktok spécial été, pour cheveux et astuces culinaires dans ma cuisine. Cette semaine, j'ai relevé le défii, en moins de 24h top chrono, de construire une piscine en carton chez moi! Le tutoriel: https://youtu.be/CsAxyxDOAS0Le projet m'a couté moins de 80$ (60€), et la piscine a vraiment bien tenue! J'ai adoré réaliser ce défi 24h dans la piscine, surtout que le projet construction a été hyper facile à réaliser, sans compétences nécessaire, un peu de bois, du scotch (pas le scotch scolaire mais celui pour construire des objets, faire du diy), et surtout du carton. Il y a plusieurs vidéos tutoriel sur YouTube qui montrent les meilleurs diy a faire avec du carton: des tables de billards, des arbres à chat, des meubles pour produits de beauté: comme des portes pinceaux à maquillage, des décorations pour la chambre, mais aussi pour faire des costumes, déguisements/cosplay pour fabriquer des objets facile d’utilisation quotidien. J’ai adoré réaliser cette sculpture en carton dans mon jardin, au milieu de mes plantes 🌱 et fleurs! J’ai maintenant un beau petit patio, une belle terrasse de jardin avec ma piscine en bois et en carton pour profiter de l’été. Vive les summer hacks! J’avais vu passer des astuces d’activités manuelles du genre sur TikTok, pour apprendre à faire les meilleures astuces culinaires, pour nous montrer comment réaliser les meilleures rénovations à la maison quand on est débutant, dans sa salle de bain, dans sa cuisine ou encore dans sa chambre.Au final, j’ai trouvé que cette activité manuelle avec du cardboard était hyper facile à réaliser. Il faut un plan bien construit, un plan bien pensé, des outils comme un marteau, des vis, une perceuse de chez Black et Decker, Dewalt ou encore makita, une agrafeuse avec des agrafes stanley, des rouleaux de scotch et biensûr du carton! Avis à tous les bricoleurs et toutes les bricoleuses, cette astuce bricolage pour la piscine est vraiment facile et très pratique. C’est comme si j’avais passé 24h dans un carton ou 24h dans ma piscine 😂 ça m’a prit quasiment 8h pour bricoler et construire cette piscine dans mon jardin de ville. Alors si vous vous demandez comment construire la piscine de vos rêves ou encore comment réaliser un record du monde, sortie de votre zone de confort et devenir le meilleur bricoleur de tous les temps, suivez le tutoriel diy spécial été 😂Je vous promet, pour cet été, pas besoin de piscine gonflable ou encore de trouver les meilleurs endroits de la région pour aller se baigner avec la chaleur et la canicule, pour lutter comme le chaud et le beau soleil qui brille, enfilez un jean 👖 et en route pour l’aventure et pour construire la piscine en carton de vos rêves. Je vous jure, c’est le meilleur diy avec du carton, le tuto déco idéal pour sa maison ou son appartement, sur son balcon, sa terrasse ou son jardin! Bref, un diy facile à réaliser en famille et entre amis!On dirait presque un tuto minecraft, vous ne trouvez pas? On dirait que je suis dans un jeu-vidéo et que j’ai réalisé la meilleure piscine possible dans les sims 4, ou encore dans Fortnite 😂😂 sauf qu’on est pas du tout sur une console de jeu vidéo du genre PlayStation, Xbox ou encore PC, mais bel et bien dans la vraie vie.Vidéo de DENYZEECette chaîne est une chaîne youtube de divertissement et d'humour.

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

(IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

About Tifo Football:
Informative, illustrated football analysis. Home of WhiteboardFootball®.

Tifo loves football. We know there’s an appetite for thoughtful, intelligent content, for stuff that makes the complicated simple.

Our illustrated and live action YouTube videos address all aspects of the game, including tactics, history, and the business of football.

We provide analysis on the Premier League, Champions League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, World Cup and more.

Our podcasts interview some of the game’s leading figures. And our editorial covers football with depth and insight.

Tifo Football used to be uMAXit Football – we changed our name in November 2017 to better articulate who we are and what matters to us: making football accessible to its fans through story-telling and the expertise and insight of our team of writers and producers.

Tifo was nominated by the Football Supporters’ Federation for the ‘Best Online Media’ Award in 2017 and 2018.

We also make bespoke videos.#barcelona #transfers #messi"

Will Setien be sacked after the embarrassing defeat to Hansi Flick’s side (reports indicating he’s already been sacked)? What’s next for Lionel Messi? The ESPN FC crew of Craig Burley, Julien Laurens and Frank Leboeuf join Kay Murray to delve deeper into the match and assess what exactly went wrong for the La Liga side. Burley believes no one, including Lionel Messi, can lift their heads up high. Laurens addresses whether Barca have hit rock bottom and questions Setien’s tactics against the Bavarian giants.#ESPNFC #ChampionsLeague #BayernMunich #Barcelona ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC"

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Matt today, after meeting Kohl, Ethan, and Jorge previously. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Matt, who is in flight school, is super thoughtful and did a great job planning his date! He made the cutest picnic lunch for for them beside the lake, including a yummy caesar salad! Then they went paddle boarding. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos.

Growing up, I was always going back and forth between several signature scents based on my mood, the occasion, my outfit. As an adult I felt like I was “supposed” to settle more on one fragrance, and often became bored with my choice. I love that this fragrance collection is truly not just for many types of women, but for the different personalities and roles that women have from one day to the next. With so many decisions to make every day as an actor, an entrepreneur and now a mom, I love the idea that Cacharel not only offers fragrances for the multi-faceted modern woman, but that this collection caters to the many, many roles that women play in today’s society by offering a variety of fragrances to suit every moment.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Wallace overreacted sometimes and complained plenty, but he wasn't merely a whiner. Fair or not, Sheed detected, and sought to call out, bias among the NBA's refs. He's far from the only person to suggest that refs get emotional, play favorites, or bring ulterior motives to the court. He is, however, one of the players to make that point on the court. He made it consistently and boldly, and in a way that drew extra ire from the very refs he accused of targeting him. In short, this was a crusade that turned a typically-tense relationship into outright beef. While he played, it was Sheed vs. Basically Every Ref. And even in retirement, Wallace is not done fighting that battle.Edited by Ryan SimmonsWritten and produced by Seth RosenthalSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

Hear why Shannon Sharpe is concerned about the Lakers moving forward in the bubble.#Undisputed #NBA #KyleKuzma #LeBron #AnthonyDavis #Lakers #NuggetsSUBSCRIBE to get the latest UNDISPUTED content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTEDListen to UNDISPUTED on Spotify: https://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDSpotifyThe all-new FOX Sports App, build for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb►Watch the latest content from UNDISPUTED: https://foxs.pt/TheLatestOnUNDISPUTED▶First Things First's YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD▶Speak for Yourself’s YouTube channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVESee more from UNDISPUTED: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFoxSportsLike UNDISPUTED on Facebook: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDFacebookFollow UNDISPUTED on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDTwitterFollow UNDISPUTED on Instagram: http://foxs.pt/UNDISPUTEDInstagramFollow Skip Bayless on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/SkipBaylessTwitterFollow Shannon Sharpe on Twitter: http://foxs.pt/ShannonSharpeTwitterFollow Jenny Taft on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/JennyTaftTwitterAbout Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED:UNDISPUTED is a daily two-and-a-half hour sports debate show starring Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharpe.

J'ai 24h pour construire la plus gross piscine du monde avec comme matériaux principal: du carton!➡️  Rejoins la famille en t'abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.✌️➡️  La suite de l'aventure sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Qui n'a jamais rêvé d'avoir une piscine chez soi, dans son jardin? Il y a quelques semaines, j'ai essayé de reproduire des tutoriels et astuces tiktok spécial été, pour cheveux et astuces culinaires dans ma cuisine. Cette semaine, j'ai relevé le défii, en moins de 24h top chrono, de construire une piscine en carton chez moi! Le tutoriel: https://youtu.be/CsAxyxDOAS0Le projet m'a couté moins de 80$ (60€), et la piscine a vraiment bien tenue! J'ai adoré réaliser ce défi 24h dans la piscine, surtout que le projet construction a été hyper facile à réaliser, sans compétences nécessaire, un peu de bois, du scotch (pas le scotch scolaire mais celui pour construire des objets, faire du diy), et surtout du carton. Il y a plusieurs vidéos tutoriel sur YouTube qui montrent les meilleurs diy a faire avec du carton: des tables de billards, des arbres à chat, des meubles pour produits de beauté: comme des portes pinceaux à maquillage, des décorations pour la chambre, mais aussi pour faire des costumes, déguisements/cosplay pour fabriquer des objets facile d’utilisation quotidien. J’ai adoré réaliser cette sculpture en carton dans mon jardin, au milieu de mes plantes 🌱 et fleurs! J’ai maintenant un beau petit patio, une belle terrasse de jardin avec ma piscine en bois et en carton pour profiter de l’été. Vive les summer hacks! J’avais vu passer des astuces d’activités manuelles du genre sur TikTok, pour apprendre à faire les meilleures astuces culinaires, pour nous montrer comment réaliser les meilleures rénovations à la maison quand on est débutant, dans sa salle de bain, dans sa cuisine ou encore dans sa chambre.Au final, j’ai trouvé que cette activité manuelle avec du cardboard était hyper facile à réaliser. Il faut un plan bien construit, un plan bien pensé, des outils comme un marteau, des vis, une perceuse de chez Black et Decker, Dewalt ou encore makita, une agrafeuse avec des agrafes stanley, des rouleaux de scotch et biensûr du carton! Avis à tous les bricoleurs et toutes les bricoleuses, cette astuce bricolage pour la piscine est vraiment facile et très pratique. C’est comme si j’avais passé 24h dans un carton ou 24h dans ma piscine 😂 ça m’a prit quasiment 8h pour bricoler et construire cette piscine dans mon jardin de ville. Alors si vous vous demandez comment construire la piscine de vos rêves ou encore comment réaliser un record du monde, sortie de votre zone de confort et devenir le meilleur bricoleur de tous les temps, suivez le tutoriel diy spécial été 😂Je vous promet, pour cet été, pas besoin de piscine gonflable ou encore de trouver les meilleurs endroits de la région pour aller se baigner avec la chaleur et la canicule, pour lutter comme le chaud et le beau soleil qui brille, enfilez un jean 👖 et en route pour l’aventure et pour construire la piscine en carton de vos rêves. Je vous jure, c’est le meilleur diy avec du carton, le tuto déco idéal pour sa maison ou son appartement, sur son balcon, sa terrasse ou son jardin! Bref, un diy facile à réaliser en famille et entre amis!On dirait presque un tuto minecraft, vous ne trouvez pas? On dirait que je suis dans un jeu-vidéo et que j’ai réalisé la meilleure piscine possible dans les sims 4, ou encore dans Fortnite 😂😂 sauf qu’on est pas du tout sur une console de jeu vidéo du genre PlayStation, Xbox ou encore PC, mais bel et bien dans la vraie vie.Vidéo de DENYZEECette chaîne est une chaîne youtube de divertissement et d'humour.

In this video, I’m revealing my greatest tips for getting 6 pack abs fast. As you would expect, these will be a mix of nutrition and workout tips for abs. You simply cannot get a ripped six pack without paying attention to both sides of the equation.With that said, we start right off ironically in the bathroom for a nutrition tip. That’s right, you want to start where you day starts with rehydration. Likely you have not had any water since before you went to bed. This can leave you dehydrated. The best thing you can do for your body is drink 16-20 ounces of water upon waking before doing anything else, simply to try and get ahead of the deficit. Whether you are trying to increase your metabolism or improve the quality of your ab workouts, you need to have plenty of water to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each.Speaking of what to do first, the next tip for getting abs has to do with the sequence of something else - your ab workouts. It’s less important which ab exercises you choose as it is which order you perform them in. Be sure to perform lower ab movements (ones that involve isolated movement of the legs) first in your training and save the top down movements for last. In the name of exercise efficiency, this order will save you from attempting your hardest ab exercises when you are least capable of performing them well.When it comes to eating, remember this nutrition tip and you will be way ahead of the game when it comes to achieving your fat loss goals and you won’t even have to count a single calorie in the process. Pretend your plate is a clock and make an imaginary line for 9 o’clock and nine twenty. Fill the largest portion of the plate with fibrous carbs. If you’re looking for a resource for the best choices be sure to visit http://athleanx.com/carbs. Fill the second largest portion with protein. Fill the remaining portion with starchy carbs and top with a small amount of incidental fat. Keep the portions low without heaping and you will find this simple strategy is something you can use anywhere.When it comes to your ab workouts, be sure to not focus on counting reps but rather making your reps count. I like to say, it’s better to count meaningful contractions and not reps. If you do a rep that you speed through and don’t really feel it in the muscles you’re trying to work, then don’t count it. When you trade in quality for quantity, your chances of getting a carved out six pack are dramatically increased.When it comes to specific techniques that you can apply to your ab exercises for a 6 pack be sure to do the following. On all lower ab exercises, focus on lifting the pelvis not the legs. Also, when able, be sure to squeeze your knees together to activate the adductors which provides stability to the pelvis from below and gives you a better engagement of the lower abs.For the upper abs, pretend there is a line just at the bottom of your ribcage. From here, try and fold your body upon that line. Focusing on lifting the shoulder blades off the ground rather than pulling on your neck will make this easier to make sure you get right.In the kitchen, there are a few things you can add to your daily diet that alone won’t make much of an impact but together can have a significant one. Here I like to recommend including green tea (either as a supplement or something you drink), cinnamon (I like to include the Ceylon version in my oatmeal every morning) and red pepper flakes (providing capsaicin to assist in fat loss efforts). All of these are naturally included in my meals and done so consistently.Breathing is another thing you want to make sure you get right when doing your ab training. If you don’t, you could wind up with 6 pack abs and have it look distended and bloated. The key is not to push your abdomen out as you exhale on your exercises. Instead, cinch the waist down by engaging the transverse abdominis and exhale at the same time. Will take some practice if you’re not used to it but becomes second nature later.The remainder of the 13 tips to get 6 pack abs are included in the video. Be sure to watch them all and let me know which of them you found most helpful or eye opening.

(This #10DatesIn10Days is mostly for fun, but we are all secretly hoping she finds her BOO!) You'll meet Kohl today, after meeting Ethan and Jorge last week. You can vote for your favorites each week, and at the end of the 10 dates she'll go on a SECOND date with whoever ya'll (along with her) help choose!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) http://www.brooklynandbaileyshop.com Our friend Alyssa Mikesell did the 15 date/15 day version and ended up finding her BOYFRIEND! Her mom, Betsy Mikesell (and our Beddy's partner), had a dream that Brooklyn just HAD TO DO THIS too!!!! She felt inspired that Brooklyn would find her boyfriend as well, and called Brooklyn immediately the next morning! You can follow both Alyssa and Betsy HERE! Alyssa Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKWfroBPkXYzBsyNdAuK8w Betsy Mikesell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmZNqqNBVbLU1kT1T-YmSZw When Betsy called her, Brooklyn kind of laughed it off... but as she thought about it more and more, she decided it would be FUN to do something like this (with zero pressure to find someone)! Betsy has been like an aunt to us, so Brooklyn AGREED! Betsy and Alyssa quickly went to work, posting on their IGS for their followers to have their cute brothers or sons apply! Both Betsy and her friend Kaitlyn took turns filming with Brooklyn on the dates.(UPDATE: Since filming ended, Betsy was involved in a plane crash with her family. Everyone survived, but they still need your prayers... especially her husband, Gentry! It has been a long week, as I am sure you can imagine, and we've all been trying to support the family as much as we can. They are amazing friends, and could DEFINITELY use your prayers, thoughts, and well wishes! You can watch her video and leave comments HERE: https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU)The idea for this series is... that Brooklyn films her 10 Dates in 10 Days and we will upload them HERE every MWF starting today! So you'll be getting several videos from us EACH WEEK for the next 3 weeks or so! THEN as you watch each video, you can VOTE in the comment for the boy you think matches up THE BEST with Brooklyn for that video. As each video goes live, you might have to go back and watch the others again just to see which boy you think Brooklyn vibes THE MOST with!Each boy plans his own #date, and not only are these boys CUTE... but they are SUPER FUN and planned great date ideas! Brooklyn is having so much fun! (Safety precautions are taken to ensure safety based on CDC guidelines. The boys have been asked to either social distance with their families or take a test prior to filming, temperature checks before dates, masks in public with appropriate social distancing, and hand sanitizer breaks.) Kohl did a great job planning his date with a few super fun activities! Indoor skydiving, painting, and ice cream. Is this it??? Do you think Brooklyn will find her #boyfriend in this series??? She's been single for three years now, but I SURE DO HOPE SO! *no pressure*If this video series does well, do you think we should TRY IT WITH KAMRI NEXT???This video was just as fun to film as our recent Twin Swap videos. You can check those out here!💥 Identical Twins Switch Places | Will Bailey’s Boyfriend Notice?

In the case of UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic's rubber match with Daniel Cormier at UFC 252, however, the third meeting surpassed anything that happened in the first two bouts as Miocic managed to outwork Cormier over five rounds for a unanimous decision victory in a thrilling battle.The hype train of rising bantamweight Sugar Sean O'Malley took a detour on its trip toward crossover stardom after an apparent leg injury led to an opportunistic finish from Marlon Chito Vera on Saturday.The first round and a half of the UFC 252 heavyweight clash between Jairzinho Rozenstruik and Junior dos Santos belonged to dos Santos, but Rozenstruik proved once again that it only takes one of his shots to turn a fight, scoring a TKO in the second round to rebound from a devastating loss in his last outing.SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL:https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSSportsHQ FOLLOW US ON:Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/CBSSports/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cbssports/Twitter - https://twitter.com/CBSSports#UFC252 #Miocic #Cormier #UFC #MMA #SugarSeanOMalley #ChitoVera #Rozenstruik #JuniorDosSantos"

Bayern Munich went into their Champions League quarterfinal against Barcelona as apparent favorites, but would anyone have predicted they’d score EIGHT past Quique Setien’s side? Will Setien be sacked after the embarrassing defeat to Hansi Flick’s side (reports indicating he’s already been sacked)? What’s next for Lionel Messi? The ESPN FC crew of Craig Burley, Julien Laurens and Frank Leboeuf join Kay Murray to delve deeper into the match and assess what exactly went wrong for the La Liga side. Burley believes no one, including Lionel Messi, can lift their heads up high. Laurens addresses whether Barca have hit rock bottom and questions Setien’s tactics against the Bavarian giants.#ESPNFC #ChampionsLeague #BayernMunich #Barcelona ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC"
